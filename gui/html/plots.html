	<h1>Making plots</h1>

	<h2>Software</h2>
	<p>
	Rdd does not make plots itself. Rdd produces files that contain the 
	information to generate plots from. The scripts <code>plot-entropy.py
	</code> and <code>plot-md5.py</code> produce the plots. These scripts 
	are written in the Python scripting language. You can freely download 
	Python and view the documentation on Python 
	<a href=http://www.python.org>here</a>. 
	</p><p>
	Both scripts use Gnuplot to draw the plot. You must have Gnuplot 
	installed to draw the plots. You can freely download Gnuplot and view
	the documentation on Gnuplot <a href=http://www.gnuplot.info>here</a>.
	</p>

	<h2>Making an entropy plot</h2>
	
	<p>
	The <code>plot-entropy</code> script builds a plot of the entropy of 
	all blocks that are read by rdd. The plot is displayed or saved as a 
	PNG graphics file. To let the script display the plot you need to have 
	a running X-window environment. 
	</p><p>
	The usage of plot-entropy:
	<code>plot-entropy &lt;options&gt; infile [lo hi]</code>
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><code>infile</code>: This is the input file, the file 
		rdd generated.</li>
		<li><code>lo</code>: This is the first block of the optional 
		range of blocks to be plotted.</li>
		<li><code>hi</code>: This is the last block of the optional 
		range of blocks to be plotted.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	The options:	
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><code>-o</code>: The PNG output file. If an output file is 
		given, the script will not try to draw the plot on the 
		screen.</li>
		<li><code>-t</code>: This will be the title of the plot. This 
		not the filename of the PNG file.</li>
		<li><code>-b</code>: This is the blocksize rdd used to 
		calculate the entropy on a block. The script needs this 
		blocksize to correctly print the locations of the blocks 
		of which the entropies are calculated.</li>
		<li><code>-x</code>: This is the name of an optional file that 
		contains a list of blocks that must not be plotted.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>	
	An example:	
	</p><p>	
	<code># rdd-copy -h 32768 -H entropy.txt</code>
	<br>
	<code># plot-entropy -o entropy-plot.png -t "Entropy plot of suspect's 
	harddisk" -b 32768 entropy.txt</code>
	</p><p>	
	This will make a PNG file with a plot of all blocks rdd read. The 
	title will be "Entropy plot of suspect's harddisk". We specify that 
	rdd used a blocksize of 32768 bytes.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Making an MD5 plot</h2>
	
	<p>
	Making an MD5 plot is very similar to making an entropy plot, although 
	the script has fewer options. Please refer to 'Making an entropy plot'.
	</p>

	<h2>Interpreting the plots</h2>
	
	<p>
	The entropy plot is straightforward. The X axis covers all 
	blocks in the image. The Y axis covers the entropy values. The 
	entropy ranges from 0 to 8, where 8 stands for high entropy and 0 
	stands for low entropy. Every block of which the entropy has been 
	calculated is plotted with a '+' symbol.

	<strong>Figure 1: An entropy plot</strong>

	</p><p>
	This is an example of an entropy plot. The first 0.17 GB contains data 
	with various entropy levels. This indicates lots of different types 
	of data. The rest of the disk contains data with a very high entropy. 
	This <i>could</i> be a crypto container or a heavily compressed file.
	</p><p>
	Correctly interpreting the block-MD5 plot is more difficult. In the 
	block-MD5 plot the X axis covers the number of unique MD5 hash 
	values of blocks. The Y axis covers the number of blocks that are 
	covered by a single hash value. The Y axis is cummulative, which means 
	every new value is added to the values that are already processed.
	</p><p>

	<br>
	<strong>Figure 2: A block-MD5 plot</strong>

	</p><p>
	This is an example of a block-MD5 plot. The plot consists roughly of 
	2 straight lines. The left line shows that approximately 4900 
	different MD5 hash values on the X axis are used to cover 
	approximately 4900 blocks on the Y axis. This means that all these 
	4900 blocks from the image have a different MD5 hash value. From 
	(4900, 4900) on the line goes straight up. This line tells us that 
	only 8 MD5 hash values are used to cover appox. 47000 blocks 
	(52000 - 4900). This means that  these 47000 blocks contain a lot of 
	duplicated information. The block-MD5 plot is a cumulative plot and 
	gives no information on the locations of the plotted blocks on the 
	evidence material.
	</p><p>
	Both plots are actually from the same harddisk drive. By looking only 
	to the entropy plot you might assume that you are dealing with some 
	kind of crypto container or a large, heavily compressed file. By 
	combining both plots you see that the blocks of the disk with a high 
	entropy are covered by just 8 blocks. You might want to put your 
	effort in the other part of the harddisk drive first.
	</p><p>
	The plots are meant to give an indication on the type of data on a 
	disk. They are not intended to be used as a strict rule out mechanism 
	to limit the amount of data to process. A low entropy does not 
	guarantee that there is no important evidence nor does a high entropy 
	guarantee data worth a deeper investigation.
