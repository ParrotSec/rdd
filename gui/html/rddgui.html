<div id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
	
	<p>
	Rddgui is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the Robust Disk 
	Duplicaitor (rdd) imaging software. Rdd used to be a command line 
	utililty. With version 2.0 it comes with a GUI that can be used to 
	avoid typing long command lines. A command line version of rdd is 
	still available.
	</p><p>
	This help applies to rddgui verision 1.0. It might be useful for later 
	versions too, although some modifications might be made to the user
	interface. This help might also be useful for the command line version 
	of rdd because it extensively explains all options. The options on the 
	rdd command line version are the same, the only difference is the GUI.
	</p>

</div>

<div id="screens">
<h2>Screens</h2>
	
	<p>
	All screens in the GUI have a Help button. Clinking this button will
	show this help page.
	</p><p>
	The screens are connected to each other in a wizard like style. 
	Clicking the Next button will show the next screen while the 
	Previous button will show the previous screen.
	</p><p>
	Some settings, like e.g. the input file or device settings can be 
	customized to a high level. The regular settings are displayed in the 
	wizard like screen while the less regular and more difficult settings
	are 'hidden' behind an Advanced button.
	</p><p>
	Whenever a path to a file or device must be entered, there is a 
	Browse button available. This button will show a file open dialog 
	screen in which the file or device can be selected.

<div id="imageorverify">
<h3>Image or Verify</h3>

	<p>
	The rdd-gui can make an image or verify an image that already has 
	been made. An image is a bitstream copy of all bytes of a device or 
	file.
	</p>

</div>

<div id="network">
<h3>Network</h3>

	<p>	
	Rdd can run in 3 modes:
	</p>

	<ol>
	<li> Local mode </li>
	<li> Client mode </li>
	<li> Server mode </li>
	</ol>

	<h4>Local mode</h4>
	
	<p>
	Local mode does not use a network in which two versions of rdd are 
	communicating with each oter. In local mode, rdd makes an 
	image of a file or device and stores it either as an image file or on a
	target device. The file or device must be avialable on the computer 
	rdd is running on. The location can be on a server that is avialable on 
	your network.
	</p>

	<h4>Client mode</h4>
	
	<p>
	In client mode, rdd reads the device or file that has to be imaged.
	The data read from the device or file is transmitted over the 
	network to a computer running rdd in server mode. Because in client
	mode rdd reads the file or device, the file or device must be 
	accessible by rdd.
	</p>

	<h4>Server mode</h4>
	
	<p>
	In server mode, rdd reads the data that is transmitted by another 
	computer running rdd in client mode and stores it as an image file
	or on a target device. Rdd in server mode is typically run on a 
	server that stores several images.
	</p>
</div>

<div id="profile">
<h3>Profile</h3>

	<p>
	By selecting a profile, the GUI sets some default values for the 
	chosen profile. The list of profiles contains several types of media.
	All settings that are set to default values can be changed in screens 
	that are to come.
	</p>
</div>

<div id="input">
<h3>Input</h3>

	<p>
	The input file or device is the file or device you want to image. You 
	must specify this file or device. 
	</p><p>
	Rdd is designed not to change the input file or device. But, as all 
	software, rdd is not free of bugs. When possible, use a hardware 
	writeblocking device.
	</p>
</div>

<div id="input-advanced">
<h3>Input, advanced</h3>

	<p>
	Rdd can read the input file or device from the start to the end. 
	</p><p>
	Rdd can also read any part of the file. The following items can be set:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Offset: The number of bytes to skip before starting to 
		read.</li>
		<li>Read: The number of bytes rdd has to read.</li>
		<li>Blocksize: the number of bytes rdd must read at a time. 
		In general, the larger the blocksize, the faster rdd will 
		work.  From a certain blocksize the gain in speed will be 
		minimal by increasing the blocksize. The default blocksize of 
		rdd is 256 kB. Some special media might use a fixed blocksize 
		and will not respond to other blocksizes.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	All values can be specified in bytes, kilobytes (kB), Megabytes (MB) 
	and Gigabytes (GB).
	</p>
</div>

<div id="output">
<h3>Output</h3>

	<p>
	You must specify the output image and the logfile. 
	</p><p>
	The output image can be a file or a device and must be specified.
	</p><p>
	Rdd logs all its activity to a file. This file must be specified.
	</p>
</div>

<div id="output-advanced">
<h3>Output, advanced</h3>

	<p>
	Rdd can write the output image as one piece or rdd can split the output 
	image in files of a specified size. When splitting, rdd will add a 
	sequence number to the names of the output files.
	</p><p>
	Splitting an ouput image can be useful if you know you will have to 
	burn a large image on a set of cd-recordables. 
	</p><p>
	Some filesystems like FAT12, FAT16, and FAT32 have a maximum file size.
	These filesystems can not handle files larger than this size.
	</p>
</div>

<div id="integrity">
<h3>Integrity</h3>

	<p>
	Rdd can calculate MD5 and SHA-1 hash values over the bytes it reads.
	</p>
	
<h4>Which Algorithm?</h4>

	<p>
	We recommend that you use both MD5 <i>and</i> SHA-1.
	MD5 is widely used, but its one-way hash function has been under
	attack for a while.
	</p>

<h4>Verification</h4>

	<p>
	We recommend that you compare the MD5 or SHA-1 hash value that
	rdd calculated during imaging with the MD5 or SHA-1 hash values 
	obtained by:
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>hashing the content of the input device;</li>
		<li>hashing the image file rdd produced.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
	For this check, we recommend you use other software than rdd. Linux 
	<code>md5sum</code> and <code>sha1sum</code> are good options.
	</p><p>
	When your device reports non reproducable readerrors, the verification 
	hash might not be the same as the hash rdd calculated.
	</p>

	</ol>
</div>

<div id="integrity-advanced">
<h3>Integrity, advanced</h3>

	<p>
	Besides calculating an MD5 or SHA-1 hash rdd can calculate Adler-32 
	checksums and CRC-32 checksums over the bytes it reads. Where MD5 and 
	SHA-1 hashes are calculated over the complete input file or device, 
	Adler-32 and CRC-32 checksums are calculated over smaller blocks of 
	data. All Adler-32 checksums are written to one file and all CRC-32 
	checksums are written to one file.
	</p><p>
	When you have an rdd image with one of these checksum files, and 
	the hash of the image is different from the hash rdd calculated during 
	imaging, rdd can pinpoint the exact blocknumbers that have been 
	changed.
	</p><p>
	This screen has boxes for selecting the checksum method, the size of
	the block to calculate checksums over, and the files in which all 
	checksums are written.
	</p><p>
	In most cases it is not necessary to calculate both Adler-32 checksums 
	CRC-32 checksums. One checksumming method is enough. Adler-32 is a bit 
	faster than CRC-32. Checksumming can be used in addition to hashing. 
	Checksumming is not implemented in rdd to replace hashing because
	checksums are much less distinguishing than hashes.
	</p><p>
	A blocksize of 64 kB is the default value in rdd. You clould select
	larger blocksizes for large hard disk drives. This will reduce the 
	size of the checksum file. For smaller media, like a floppy disk, 
	you might want to use a smaller blocksize. We recommend not to use 
	blocksizes smaller than 64 kB for the Adler-32 checkusum because the 
	checksums might not be distinguishing enough with smaller blocksizes.

<div id="error-recovery">
<h3>Error recovery</h3>

	<p>
	Most copying software read files or devices in blocks, using a certain 
	blocksize. When they encounter a read error, the whole block of e.g. 
	256 kB, will be lost. Even though only one sector of 512 bytes was 
	damaged and is responsible for the read errors. In this case nearly 256 
	kB of data is lost unnecessary.
	</p><p>
	Rdd will reduce its blocksize when it encounters a read error when the 
	option for error recovery is chosen. Reducing the blocksize and 
	retrieving as much data as possible was one of the major design goals 
	rdd. 
	</p><p>
	Choosing error-recovery will set the default values. To what 
	blocksize rdd reduces its blocksize, can be set in the Error-recocery 
	Advanced screen. The deault size is 512 bytes.
	</p><p>
	When rdd is unable to read the block, it will replace the block with 
	zero bytes in the image.
	</p>
</div>

<div id="error-recovery-advanced">
<h3>Error recovery, Advanced</h3>
	
	<p>
	When rdd encounters a read error it will try to read the block it was 
	reading with a blocksize of the retry blocksize. The default value is 
	512 bytes. This is the sector size of a hard disk drive. Setting a 
	smaller blocksize when imaging a hard disk drive is useless because a 
	standard hard disk drive will never read less bytes than 512.
	</p><p>
	The operating system might try to read a damaged block a couple of 
	times. Rdd can drop the block after a certain number of retries and 
	proceed to the next block.
	</p><p>
	Trying to recover as much as possible can take a lot of time. Rdd can 
	give up after processing a certain number of damaged blocks or rdd can 
	proceed until a crash of the operating system or a power brownout.
	</p>

</div>

<div id="statistics">
<h3>Statistics</h3>

	<p>
	Rdd can calculate the entropy and the MD5 hash value of blocks of 
	bytes it reads. These entropy and MD5 hash values are stored in 
	textfiles. Rdd comes with programs that can produce a plot of the
	entropy and block-MD5 values from these textfiles.
	</p><p>
	The entropy of a group of bytes is a measure of the amount of 
	randomness of the bytes in the group. Good predictability (poor 
	randomness) results in a low entropy and poor predictability (good 
	randomness) results in a high entropy. An expample of good 
	predictability is a block containing zeroes. Examples of poor 
	predictability are files that are crypted with a good crypto algorithm 
	or files that are heavily compressed. Calculating the entropy 
	can help distinguishing between unused areas and areas that might 
	contain a crypto container or heavily compressed data.
	</p><p>
	Besides calculating an MD5 hash over the complete image, rdd can 
	calculate an MD5 hash over blocks it reads. Calculating MD5 hash values 
	over blocks can show if the evidence contains much re-occurring blocks. 
	In most cases, blocks that have a high entropy cannot be discarded. 
	Although a series of blocks have a high entropy, the blocks might be 
	exactly the same. Analyzing the block-MD5 plot together with the 
	entropy plot might reduce the amount of bytes worth researching.
	</p>

	<h4>How to make the plots?</h4>

</div>

<div id=networking>
<h3>Networking</h3>
	
	<p>
	Rdd can use a network to transprort an image from one computer to 
	another. Rdd uses the TCP/IP protocol over an ethernet connection. 
	Before you try to establish a connection, make sure you have a computer 
	with a network card installed and your computer supports the TCP/IP and 
	ethernet protocols.
	</p><p>
	When rdd runs in client mode, rdd reads the file or device that must be 
	imaged. Instead of storing the image locally, all data is sent over a 
	network to another computer that runs rdd in server mode. Rdd in 
	server mode receives the image and stores it locally. To minimize the 
	network load the image can be sent in a compressed format.
	</p><p>
	All settings like selecting the file or device to image, the blockize, 
	etc. are configured in rdd running in client mode. Even the location 
	where to store the file on the server is selected in client mode. 
	Before the image is sent, the rdd client notifies the rdd server where 
	to store the image.
	</p><p>
	Rdd in client mode will try to establish a connection to the specified 
	rdd server. The server must therefore be configured first. It must be 
	'listening' on the network for an rdd client that wants to establish a 
	connection.
	</p><p>
	Make sure there is a  network route from the rdd client to the rdd 
	server and that it is not blocked by a firewall. If a firewall is 
	blocking the route you will have to open a port on the firewall. You 
	can configure rdd to use any TCP port.
	</p>

</div>
	
<div id=client>
<h3>Client mode settings</h3>

	<p>
	Please refer to the <a href="#networking">Networking</a> section of for 
	the basics of rdd in client mode and rdd in server mode.
	</p><p>
	In this screen you can configure rdd in client mode. You can enter the 
	name or the IP address of the computer that is running rdd in server 
	mode. The image can be compressed to minimize the network load and 
	increase the speed. In most cases the network speed will be lower than 
	the speed of the hard disk drive. Reducing the number of bytes to send 
	will reduce the time that is needed to perform an imaging operation 
	over a network.
	</p><p>
	Rdd in client mode will write a log file on the connection and 
	transferring the image <i>locally</i>. This file is not sent over the 
	network. This logfile will look much the same as the logfile rdd makes 
	in local mode. Note that the compression option does not apply to the 
	logfile. It only applies to the image that is sent over the network.

<h3>Verify an image</h3>


	<p>
	Rdd can canculate MD5 and SHA-1 hashes over all bytes it reads. Besides 
	these hashes over the complete image, rdd can calculate Adler-32 and 
	CRC-32 checksums over blocks of data it reads. All these hashes and 
	checksums can be used, up to a certain extent, to verify the integrity 
	of an image produced by rdd. 
	</p><p>
	Please refer to the sections <a href="#integrity">Integrity</a> and 
	<a href="#integrity-advanced">Integrity, advanced</a> for a discussion 
	on these hashes and checksums.

	In this screen you can conofigure the following items:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>The image to verify.</li>
		<li>The file to write the logging information on verifying an

		<li>Wheather or not an MD5 hash must be calculated</li>
		<li>Wheather or not a SHA-1 hash must be calculated</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	Note that rdd does not verify the hashes. Verification must be done by 
	comparing the hash rdd calculates at verifying with the hash rdd 
	calculated at imaging.
	</p><p>
	The default is that rdd expects an Adler-32 checksum file is available
